                <p>Pua Magasiva, a well-known New Zealand actor, was born in Apia, Samoa, on August 10, 1980. He moved to New Zealand at an early age with his family, where he grew up and attended school. Pua's older brother, Robbie Magasiva, a successful actor himself, inspired him to pursue acting. He gained early recognition through small acting roles, leading to his breakout performances in Power Rangers Ninja Storm as the Red Wind Ranger in 2003 and later in the New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street. His career spanned film, television, theater, and radio, where he became a co-host on the New Zealand radio station Flava. Despite his success, Pua faced personal struggles, which ultimately led to his tragic death in 2019 at the age of 38.</p>
